# LangGraph

This repository contains my practice work as an initiator for  **PyLadies AI Agents Study Group**, following the steps of building AI agents with Python. It covers everything from a simple "baby agent" to more sophisticated multi-step bots.

I followed the **LangGraph Complete Course for Beginners – Complex AI Agents with Python** by Vaibhav Mehra and also used the **Hugging Face AI Agents Course** as guidance. I made some modifications to accommodate the latest versions of LangGraph and related libraries.

## Overview

The course and this repository guide you through:

1. **Baby Agent**  
   - Simple agent with a single node and basic state.
   - Demonstrates the core concepts: **State, Steps, Control Flow** (Brain + Body).  

2. **Conditional Agent**  
   - Agents that make decisions based on state or inputs.  

3. **Sequential Agent**  
   - Agents that perform multiple steps in order, updating state at each step.  

4. **Bot / Multi-Step Agent**  
   - Combines multiple nodes and more complex workflows.
   - Can interact with tools, external APIs, and manage multi-step processes.  

5. **Advanced Agents**  
   - Integration with LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).
   - Conditional branching, multi-agent orchestration, and agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
